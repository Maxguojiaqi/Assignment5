# Assignment 5  Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 


```
After open the planner, current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
If I scroll down, the timeblocks for standard business hours will be presented
Viewing the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
When click into a timeblock, user could enter logs, logs will be stored for the browser after click on the lock button.
```

```
